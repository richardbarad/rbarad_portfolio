Hello! My name is Richard Barad and I recently graduated with a Masters Degree in Urban Spatial Analytics from the University of Pennsylvania at the Weitzman School of Design. I have experience with a wide range of data analysis, data visualization, and GIS tools including ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, Q-GIS, R, Python, SQL, Microsoft Power BI, and Carto. I am currently looking for a full time job where I can apply my data and GIS skills to policy issues. My subject matter interests and areas of experience include transportation, climate change, sustainability and environmental planning, and food security. 

Prior to attending Penn, I lived in Washington DC and spent eight years working in the International Development and Humanitarian Sectors. I worked for six years at the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a project which provides early warning on food insecurity issues around the globe. At FEWS NET, I conducted data analysis using python tools, developed interactive dashboard tools using Power BI and ArcGIS Online and provided ad-hoc GIS analysis and mapping support. I also previously worked as a Product Manager at the World Resources Institute where I managed WRIâ€™s forest atlas initiative, a suite of tools used to build national forest and land use monitoring platforms.
